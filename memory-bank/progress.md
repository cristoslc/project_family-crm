## Known Issues

None yet (pre-implementation)

## Evolution of Decisions

### Initial Planning
- Decided on React + Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL
- Chose separate containers over monolith
- Selected simple API key auth
- Designed mobile-first UI

### Schema Refinements
- Added `active` boolean for soft deletes
- Made `household_id` nullable in people (allow unassigned)
- Added `visibility_hint` for privacy filtering
- Added `recorded_by` for tracking who created records

### UX Refinements
- Added "Save & Add Another" for rapid entry
- Included preset value buttons ($10, $25, etc.)
- Designed chip-based receiver selection
- Added swipe-to-delete for mobile
